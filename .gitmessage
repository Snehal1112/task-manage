# <type>: <subject>

#

# <body>

#

# <footer>

# Type should be one of the following:

# \* feat (new feature)

# \* fix (bug fix)

# \* docs (documentation)

# \* style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)

# \* refactor (refactoring production code)

# \* test (adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change)

# \* chore (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change)

#

# Subject should use imperative mood and not end with period

# Body should explain what and why vs. how

# Footer should contain any BREAKING CHANGE or reference issues

#

# Example:

# feat: add task drag and drop functionality

#

# Implement drag and drop for tasks in the Eisenhower Matrix

# to allow users to easily move tasks between quadrants.

#

# Closes #123
